# Flight_Delay-Case_Study
In this case study for my Analysis of Data course, I completed three different exercises. For the first one I was given a table of values to use naive-bayes theorem to then calculate if a flight would be delayed or not. For the second exercise, I opened and read the given FlightDelay csv using the pandas package in Python. I then made flight delay calculations for each flight, and classified each flight as Delayed (Y) or Not Delayed (N) based on these calculations. In the third exercise, I used naive-bayes to calculate the probability of a delay or not for specified flights+carriers, as well as classify the flights.
